*WORK IN PROGRESS*

The repository contains a dash/plotly/python based dashboard:

- Data from 88 weather stations is available
- Interactive map visualization: select a weather station from the map and display relevant information
- For each of the stations, a machine-learning model predicts the future values of the pollution indicators

The application is packed inside a docker container.

# The data

Data is obtained from the [open data](https://datosabiertos.jcyl.es/web/jcyl/set/es/medio-ambiente/calidad-aire-historico-horario/1284808467480) portal from the governement of Castilla y Le√≥n (Spain). The data consists of air quality measurements from 88 stations scattered in the region.
